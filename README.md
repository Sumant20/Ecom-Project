# ðŸ›’ Ecom-Project

This is the backend service for an internal e-commerce project developed at Cognizant. It exposes RESTful APIs for product management tasks such as adding, updating (with image support), deleting, and searching products by keywords. The application is built using **Spring Boot** and integrates **MySQL** via **Spring Data JPA**. Security is enforced using **JWT-based authentication**, ensuring that only authorized users can access the endpoints. The frontend is developed separately using **React.js**.
